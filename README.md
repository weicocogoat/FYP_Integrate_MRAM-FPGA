First iteration of STP&PTS module - 40 cycles for read, 23 for write

Second iteration of STP&PTS module - 23 cycles for read and write (not sync with burst module)

Third iteration of STP&PTS module - 23 cycles for read and write (synced with burst module)

Burst Module -- 23 cycles, address starts on cycle 2

Main interest should be First iteration Integration, whereby both the burst module and STP/PTS module is integrated together. There is a simple pdf inside detailing the rough timing analysis of the implementation
